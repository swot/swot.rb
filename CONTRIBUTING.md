# Contributing to Swot

This was literally my first Ruby gem, so please keep that in mind when you're looking at the code :trollface:

* Check out the latest [master](https://github.com/leereilly/swot/tree/master).
* Take a look through the [open pull requests](https://github.com/leereilly/swot/issues) in case someone else has already contributed something similar.
* Fork the project.
* Start a topic branch of your own.
* Clone and run `git submodule update --init && bundle`.
* Commit and push away. Don't forget the tests!
* Run tests with `bundle exec rake`.
* Submit a pull request.
* :boom: You've contributed to open source!

```
